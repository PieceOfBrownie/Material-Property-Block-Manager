# Material Property Block Manager

"Material Property Block Manager" is a Unity script that allows the user to instantiate and adjust a material property block by simply attaching the script to the game object of their choosing.

### How to use Material Property Block Manager
- Create or have a gameobject with at least one material attached to it;
- Attach the "Material Property Block Manager" script to it;
- If there is more than one material attached to the current game object,
  select what material the script will focus on by dragging the 'Index' slider;
- Change the needed values in the attached script to the ones you desire.


Although the .unitypackage file is the most preferable way to acquire this manager (from the Releases section), it is also okay to download the code directly from the repository.
